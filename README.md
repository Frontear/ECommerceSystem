# ECommerceSystem
An ECommerceSystem modelled after the likes of Amazon but at a significantly smaller scale. This was originally a final project for CPS209. However, there were many design constraints that forced me to develop and write my code in ways that I disliked. Many inefficiencies, amongst other things, have led to me developing a rewrite of the fundamental code base, but operating in effectively the exact same way as the assignment demanded.
