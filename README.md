# ECommerceSystem
An ECommerceSystem modelled after the likes of Amazon but at a significantly smaller scale. This is an assignment for CPS209, and majority of the coding decisions were due to the constraints set in the assignment. The code contains iterations for assignment one and two, where both built off of the same code base to introduce new functionality. Constraints and details for specific assignments can be found in the constraints folder.

## License
This branch does not have a license. This is because some majority of this code was sourced from a template given to all students. However, the *rewrite* branch does have a license.
